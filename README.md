This repo is a full, complete copy of the crswifty repo, in working enough condition to push custom payloads to the RO section of the cr50. Although it does not contain the required patch to push payloads to the RW section (due to issues with the creator trying to sell this exploit to vrp), we hope that it will be a starting point for a full exploit, and that this source code will be enough to stop profits from being collected from the reporting of this exploit through vrp. To Google employees reading this: Welcome! We normally hate you, but for once, you are welcome to peruse this repository, for it holds enough information to surely invalidate any possible profits that could be made from CRSwifty. To MercuryWorkshop, Cognito Inc, CRZero, or TitaniumNetwork members reading this: if you feel so inclined, please try to apply patches and test them - anything that can get RW working is a game change and could solve our little tsunami problem for good.

And to Writable himself: Fuck you. You betrayed your community, your friends, and most importantly, you sold out to Google. Shame on you. As some might put it, you have forgotten the face of your father, and must now head west for the crime. Onward, for your Dark Tower, young Roland, for you have no place here anymore.

## Repository Structure

The repo is divided into a two key folders:
- `src` - Contains the original CRSwifty source tree
- `releases` - Contains backups of source snapshots and release zipfiles from each CRSwifty development release, as well as the original closed-source image signer from Google
